# Outsight

Outsight is a web-based social platform where people can anonymously share their emotions and read about how others are
feeling.

Users select an emotion and write about it — briefly or in more detail. The idea is to create a space for honesty, a
place where people can find relief, understanding, and a sense of community.

The project is social and non-commercial in nature. Its goal is to normalize conversations about emotions and support
mental well-being — through simple, human connection with the stories of others.
